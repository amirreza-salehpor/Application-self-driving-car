# Application: self driving car
# Example 16
Train an AI to drive a Donkey car in a simulated environment. Apply the supervised learning method:
* First drive an example route within the simulator and collect the training data: images from the front camera along with the control commands.
* Train a CNN neural network which predicts the control command based on the front camera image.
* Test the AI model by driving a randomly created track for 1 minute.
Report a screencast video, which shows the car driving the track for approximately 1 minute.
